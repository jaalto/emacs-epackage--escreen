Description: emulation of screen(1) window configuration save/restore
 This is a sort of session manager for emacs, inspired by the unix
 screen program. This version works in every emacs version and variant
 I've ever gotten my hands on, in both X and ASCII terminal mode, so
 it's pretty portable and gives you a fairly consistent interface for
 switching back and forth between different session configurations,
 even though some if its functionality has been duplicated by standard
 facilities in some newer versions of Emacs.
 .
 You can save and restore arbitrary data when switching
 configurations. Among some of the default things saved are the window
 sizes and layout, buffer marks, the state of narrowed regions (so you
 can create two narrowed views of the same buffer simply by switching
 screens), menu bars, buffer order, etc.
